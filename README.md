## ⚙️ Customization

### Motivational Quotes

export const motivationalQuotes = {
    "4.0-4.3": ["Excellence is your habit!"],
    "3.5-3.9": ["Almost there, keep pushing!"],
    ...
};
```

### Validation Ranges
Adjust CGPA or credit ranges in `script.js`:
```javascript
restrictToNumbers(currentCGPAInput, 0.0, 4.3); // CGPA range
restrictToNumbers(completedCreditsInput, 0, 160); // Credit range
```
